# Java_Developer_Assignment
Call Center Analytics, Connecting java code with MySQL DB using Java Database Connection to Query the Desired data from huge DB's and optimizing query to get the efficient output considering time and space complexities.

We are creating a project to calculate analytics from the call data saved for a callcenter.
Each call that is received by the callcenter is saved in a database table.

Objective:-
To create the following analytics;
1> Hour of the day when the call volume is highest.
2> Hour of the day when the calls are longest.
3> Day of the week when the call volume is highest.
4> Day of the week when the calls are longest.

Focus:-
Call data is available for many years and can contain millions of rows, so the proposed solution should have a low time complexity.


Output of the assignment
The assignment can be submitted as an independent java project, which can connect to the 
database, process the data and print the output on the console.
